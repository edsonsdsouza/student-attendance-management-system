# 📝 Student Attendance Management System (Terminal-Based)

A simple, terminal-based Student Attendance Management System built using Python.  
This mini project is designed as a beginner-friendly learning project to understand **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Exception Handling** in Python.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

There are two types of users in this system:

- 👩‍🏫 **Teacher**
  - Add students
  - Mark attendance (Present/Absent)
  - View student list

- 🎓 **Student**
  - View their own attendance record

The entire system runs in the terminal and is built using **pure Python** — no databases, no third-party libraries.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Methods)
- Exception Handling
- Modular Project Structure
- Basic CLI Interaction using `input()` and loops
- Code Scalability for future versions
